**GhostVault** is a secure ephemeral messaging platform rebuilt with a modern stack (**React, TypeScript, Vite**). It features **client-side AES-256 encryption**, creating self-destructing secrets that burn after being read once. The frontend handles all encryption/decryption locally — the server never sees your unencrypted data.

> **Zero-Knowledge Architecture:** The server acts as a blind storage. All encryption/decryption happens in your browser using the user's key, which never travels to the network.

## 📋 Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- A backend API running (see [GhostVault Backend](https://github.com/JoseMiguelFN7/GhostVault-API.git))

## 🛠️ Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/JoseMiguelFN7/GhostVault-Front-React.git](https://github.com/JoseMiguelFN7/GhostVault-Front-React.git)
cd GhostVault-Front-React
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit .env and configure your API credentials. Note: Variables must start with VITE_ to be exposed to the client.

```Ini,TOML
# .env
VITE_API_DOMAIN=http://localhost:8000
VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_APP_ENV=development
VITE_APP_DEBUG=true
```

### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:5173 (or the port shown in your terminal).

## 💻 NPM Scripts

| Script | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `npm run dev` | Starts the development server with HMR. |
| `npm run build` | Compiles TypeScript and builds the app for production. |
| `npm run preview` | Locally preview the production build. |
| `npm run lint` | Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues. |

## 🔐 How It Works (Technical Flow)

### 1. The "Magic Token" Protocol
To ensure data integrity and distinguish between an incorrect password and an empty message, we append a signature before encryption:
`"Message" + "||GV-VALID||" -> Encrypt -> Payload`

Upon decryption, the client checks for this token. If missing, it confirms the encryption key was incorrect, preventing ambiguity with empty strings or corrupted data.

### 2. Creation Flow
1.  **Input:** User enters text and optionally drops files.
2.  **Key Gen:**
    * **Manual:** User provides a password.
    * **Auto:** A secure random 16-char key is generated locally.
3.  **Encryption:**
    * The message (with the Magic Token) is encrypted using AES-256.
    * Files are converted to Base64 and encrypted individually (both name and content).
4.  **Transport:** The encrypted blob (JSON containing message + files) is sent to the API via HTTPS.
5.  **Link Generation:** The app constructs a URL containing the `UUID` (returned by server) and the `Key` (in the URL hash `#`), ensuring the key is never sent to the server.

### 3. Reception Flow
1.  **Parsing:** The app extracts the `UUID` from the path and the `Key` from the URL hash.
2.  **Fetching:** The encrypted payload is retrieved from the API.
3.  **Decryption:**
    * **Auto-Decrypt:** If the URL hash is present, the app attempts to decrypt immediately.
    * **Manual:** If `requires_password` is true (or hash is missing), a modal prompts the user for the password.
4.  **Verification:** The "Magic Token" is validated. If valid, the content is displayed; otherwise, an error is shown.
5.  **Destruction:** The server automatically deletes the secret immediately after it is fetched.
